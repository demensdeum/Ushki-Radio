## Radio List API Service

Ushki Radio utilizes the **[Radio Browser API](https://www.radio-browser.info/)**, a community-driven database of worldwide radio stations.

### Integration Details

The application interacts with the API through the `RadioService.js` component. It uses the following endpoints:

- **Base URL**: `https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/json`
- **Top Stations**: Fetches stations ordered by `clickcount` to show users what's popular.
- **Search**: Queries stations by name with filters to hide broken links and prioritize popular results.

Example implementation in `RadioService.js`:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/stations/search?name=${query}&order=clickcount&reverse=true&hidebroken=true`);
```

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server for web:
   ```bash
   npm run web
   ```
3. Export for static hosting:
   ```bash
   npm run build:web
   ```

The build output will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **Why on first load I get forever load and nothing happens?**
- Your ISP might be blocking access to the [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info/) API.
